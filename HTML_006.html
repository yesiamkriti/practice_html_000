<!--paragraph-->
<p>Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google.
     It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla Firefox.[14]
      It was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android, where it is the default browser.[15] 
      The browser is also the main component of ChromeOS, where it serves as the platform for web applications.
</p>
<p>Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's free and open-source software project Chromium,
     but Chrome is licensed as proprietary freeware.[13] WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google eventually forked it to create the Blink engine;
     [16] all Chrome variants except iOS now use Blink.[17]
    </p><hr/><hr/>
<p>As of October 2022, StatCounter estimates that Chrome has a 67% worldwide browser market share (after peaking at 72.38% in November 2018)
     on personal computers (PC)
    ,[18] is most used on tablets (having surpassed Safari),
     and is also dominant on smartphones[19][20] and at 65% across all platforms combined.[21] Because of this success,
     Google has expanded the "Chrome" brand name to other products: ChromeOS,
      Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox, and Chromebase.
